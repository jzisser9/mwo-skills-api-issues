# What is the MWO Skills API?
A free and public API repository that houses skill information for the free-to-play PC game, MechWarrior Online.

# Why?
I've seen a handful of online tools for MWO and was curious where their data was sourced from. Looking at PGI's web site, I was amazed to find that they don't seem to offer any APIs, meaning these developers must be sourcing the information themselves.

I felt inspired to make other developers' lives a bit easier and source information on all skills, placing them in a publicly-available API for read-only purposes. In the future I'd like to add additional features related to skills, such as calculating skills' effects on a given 'Mech loadout.

I want this API to be shaped by the MWO community's needs, so I want users to be able to submit issues to let me know how the API can better serve them.

For now, the API's repository is private, but I do plan to make it public in the future. When that happens, issues present in this repository will be moved there.
